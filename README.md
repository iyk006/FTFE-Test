# FTFE-Test
This test will quickly determine your ability to self-debug and adapt to new API’s.

In this test, you will extract and plot the data from a ulog file. (Should have been included in the zip file). A ulog file is the data collection log 
created every flight containing all data from/of sensors, odometry, and other vehicle operation statistics.

Using the ulog file, you will create a script to plot the data from the file and submit the python file via upload to Github.

Although this test may require the installation of an OS, it makes you familiar with the stack you will be working with prior to beginning work. Don’t 
think of this as a test, but instead an introductory exercise.

This test should take about 20 minutes - 2 hours max, and gives you some insight on part of what your job will be like as well as teaching you 
core skills you may need specific to the job.

Feel free to Google whatever you please while taking this test.
